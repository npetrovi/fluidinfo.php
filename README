fluidinfo.php
=============

Fluidinfo (http://www.fluidinfo.com/) client for PHP
based on the original library from PA Parent (https://github.com/paparent/fluidinfo.php)

Uses HTTP Pipelining for tagging objects, dramatically improving speed
especially when you need to tag a lot of information.

Dependencies
============

You need PHP's pecl_http extension which can be installed via PECL.
CURL has been removed.
This uses the HttpRequestPool, HttpMessage and HttpRequest classes.
You need PHP's JSON extension which is bundled by default with
PHP 5.2.x. It can be installed too via PECL.
